Drupal 7 Ajax Form Demo

## Purpose

To demonstrate a simple example of a Drupal 7 form with AJAX interativity.

The "special" thing about this demo is that it shows how to use a custom theme to render an element group.  This custom theme is respected by the ajax layer, so there is no failure in rendering the returned ajax data.
